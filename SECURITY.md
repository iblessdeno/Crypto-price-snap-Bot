## Security Considerations

### API Keys and Tokens
- **Never** commit API keys, tokens, or sensitive credentials to the repository
- Store all sensitive data in `.env` files which are excluded from git
- Rotate API keys and tokens periodically
- Use environment-specific keys for development and production

### WhatsApp Session Security
- WhatsApp session files (`.wwebjs_auth/` directory) contain sensitive authentication data
- Never share or commit WhatsApp session files
- Regularly check for unauthorized session access
- Implement session timeout and auto-logout features

### Telegram Bot Security
- Use webhook mode in production for better security
- Implement rate limiting for bot commands
- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Restrict bot commands to authorized users when necessary

### Server Security
- Keep Node.js and all dependencies up to date
- Run the application with minimal required permissions
- Use HTTPS for all external communications
- Implement proper error handling without exposing system details
- Regular security audits of dependencies using `npm audit`

### Data Protection
- Implement rate limiting for API requests
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Don't store sensitive user data
- Regularly clean up temporary files (screenshots, logs)
- Implement proper logging without exposing sensitive information

## Best Practices

### Environment Setup
1. Use separate `.env` files for development and production
2. Restrict access to configuration files
3. Use strong, unique passwords for all services
4. Keep system and dependencies updated

### Code Security
1. Validate and sanitize all inputs
2. Use prepared statements for queries
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Regular code reviews
5. Follow secure coding guidelines

### Deployment
1. Use PM2 for process management
2. Implement proper logging
3. Regular backup of critical data
4. Monitor system resources
5. Use firewall rules to restrict access
